### Hi there, this is Hinova ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Deep Learning (Knowledge Distillation) NLP areas

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Physics Informed Neural Network, Neural Operator and Nvidia Modulus (Nov/2021)

Using new neural operator-based frameworks to learn and solve partial differential equations, AI can help us model weather forecasting 100,000x quicker â€” and carbon dioxide sequestration 60,000x quicker â€” than traditional models. Fourier Neural Operator successfully model turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution â€” which means that FNOs enable AI to make high-resolution inferences without high-resolution training data, which would be necessary for standard neural networks.
